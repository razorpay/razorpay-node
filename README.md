# Razorpay Node SDK
[![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/razorpay.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/razorpay)

Official nodejs bindings for [Razorpay API](https://docs.razorpay.com/docs/payments).

Read up here for getting started and understanding the payment flow with Razorpay: <https://docs.razorpay.com/docs/getting-started>  

## Installation

```bash
npm i razorpay --save
```

## Documentation


Documentation of Razorpay's API and their usage is available at <https://docs.razorpay.com>


### Basic Usage

Instantiate the razorpay instance with `key_id` & `key_secret`. You can obtain the keys from the dashboard app ([https://dashboard.razorpay.com/#/app/keys](https://dashboard.razorpay.com/#/app/keys))

```js
var instance = new Razorpay({
  key_id: 'YOUR_KEY_ID',
  key_secret: 'YOUR_KEY_SECRET'
})
```

The resources can be accessed via the instance. All the methods invocations follows the namespaced signature

```js
// API signature
// {razorpayInstance}.{resourceName}.{methodName}(resourceId [, params])

// example
instance.payments.fetch(paymentId)
```

Every resource method returns a promise.

```js
instance.payments.all({
  from: '2016-08-01',
  to: '2016-08-20'
}).then((response) => {
  // handle success
}).catch((error) => {
  // handle error
})
```

If you want to use callbacks instead of promises, every resource method will accept a callback function as a last parameter. The callback functions will behave as [Error First Callbacks ](http://fredkschott.com/post/2014/03/understanding-error-first-callbacks-in-node-js/)

```js
instance.payments.all({
  from: '2016-08-01',
  to: '2016-08-20'
}, function(error, response) => {
  if (error) {
    // handle error
  } else {
    // handle success
  }
})
```
